If a work-in-progress render is discarded before\n// finishing, we create a new work-in-progress by cloning the current queue.\n//\n// Both queues share a persistent, singly-linked list structure. To schedule an\n// update, we append it to the end of both queues. Each queue maintains a\n// pointer to first update in the persistent list that hasn't been processed.\n// The work-in-progress pointer always has a position equal to or greater than\n// the current queue, since we always work on that one. The current queue's\n// pointer is only updated during the commit phase, when we swap in the\n// work-in-progress.\n//\n// For example:\n//\n//   Current pointer:           A - B - C - D - E - F\n//   Work-in-progress pointer:              D - E - F\n//                                          ^\n//                                          The work-in-progress queue has\n//                                          processed more updates than current.\n//\n// The reason we append to both queues is because otherwise we might drop\n// updates without ever processing them. For example, if we only add updates to\n// the work-in-progress queue, some updates could be lost whenever a work-in\n// -progress render restarts by cloning from current. Similarly, if we only add\n// updates to the current queue, the updates will be lost whenever an already\n// in-progress queue commits and swaps with the current queue. However, by\n// adding to both queues, we guarantee that the update will be part of the next\n// work-in-progress. (And because the work-in-progress queue becomes the\n// current queue once it commits, there's no danger of applying the same\n// update twice.)\n//\n// Prioritization\n// --------------\n//\n// Updates are not sorted by priority, but by insertion; new updates are always\n// appended to the end of the list.\n//\n// The priority is still important, though. When processing the update queue\n// during the render phase, only the updates with sufficient priority are\n// included in the result. If we skip an update because it has insufficient\n// priority, it remains in the queue to be processed later, during a lower\n// priority render. Crucially, all updates subsequent to a skipped update also\n// remain in the queue *regardless of their priority*. That means high priority\n// updates are sometimes processed twice, at two separate priorities. We also\n// keep track of a base state, that represents the state before the first\n// update in the queue is applied.\n//\n// For example:\n//\n//   Given a base state of '', and the following queue of updates\n//\n//     A1 - B2 - C1 - D2\n//\n//   where the number indicates the priority, and the update is applied to the\n//   previous state by appending a letter, React will process these updates as\n//   two separate renders, one per distinct priority level:\n//\n//   First render, at priority 1:\n//     Base state: ''\n//     Updates: [A1, C1]\n//     Result state: 'AC'\n//\n//   Second render, at priority 2:\n//     Base state: 'A'            <-  The base state does not include C1,\n//                                    because B2 was skipped.\n//     Updates: [B2, C1, D2]      <-  C1 was rebased on top of B2\n//     Result state: 'ABCD'\n//\n// Because we process updates in insertion order, and rebase high priority\n// updates when preceding updates are skipped, the final result is deterministic\n// regardless of priority.

filesystem. **All** BrowserFS FileSystems should implement\n * this interface.\n *\n * Below, we denote each API method as **Core**, **Supplemental**, or\n * **Optional**.\n *\n * ### Core Methods\n *\n * **Core** API methods *need* to be implemented for basic read/write\n * functionality.\n *\n * Note that read-only FileSystems can choose to not implement core methods\n * that mutate files or metadata. The default implementation will pass a\n * NOT_SUPPORTED error to the callback.\n *\n * ### Supplemental Methods\n *\n * **Supplemental** API methods do not need to be implemented by a filesystem.\n * The default implementation implements all of the supplemental API methods in\n * terms of the **core** API methods.\n *\n * Note that a file system may choose to implement supplemental methods for\n * efficiency reasons.\n *\n * The code for some supplemental methods was adapted directly from NodeJS's\n * fs.js source code.\n *\n * ### Optional Methods\n *\n * **Optional** API methods provide functionality that may not be available in\n * all filesystems. For example, all symlink/hardlink-related API methods fall\n * under this category.\n *\n * The default implementation will pass a NOT_SUPPORTED error to the callback.\n *\n * ### Argument Assumptions\n *\n * You can assume the following about arguments passed to each API method:\n *\n * * **Every path is an absolute path.** Meaning, `.`, `..`, and other items\n *   are resolved into an absolute form.\n * * **All arguments are present.** Any optional arguments at the Node API level\n *   have been passed in with their default values.\n * * **The callback will reset the stack depth.** When your filesystem calls the\n *   callback with the requested information, it will use `setImmediate` to\n *   reset the JavaScript stack depth before calling the user-supplied callback.\n */\nexport interface FileSystem {\n  /**\n   * **Optional**: Returns the name of the file system.\n   */\n  getName(): string;\n  /**\n   * **Optional**: Passes the following information to the callback:\n   *\n   * * Total number of bytes available on this file system.\n   * * number of free bytes available on this file system.\n   *\n   * @todo This info is not available through the Node API.

In particular, these libraries\n * perform a lot of unneeded data copying, and eagerly decompress every file\n * in the zip file upon loading to check the CRC32. They also eagerly decode\n * strings. Furthermore, these libraries duplicate functionality already present\n * in BrowserFS (e.g. UTF-8 decoding and binary data manipulation).\n *\n * This filesystem takes advantage of BrowserFS's Buffer implementation, which\n * efficiently represents the zip file in memory (in both ArrayBuffer-enabled\n * browsers *and* non-ArrayBuffer browsers), and which can neatly be 'sliced'\n * without copying data. Each struct defined in the standard is represented with\n * a buffer slice pointing to an offset in the zip file, and has getters for\n * each field. As we anticipate that this data will not be read often, we choose\n * not to store each struct field in the JavaScript object; instead, to reduce\n * memory consumption, we retrieve it directly from the binary data each time it\n * is requested.\n *\n * When the filesystem is instantiated, we determine the directory structure\n * of the zip file as quickly as possible. We lazily decompress and check the\n * CRC32 of files. We do not cache decompressed files; if this is a desired\n * feature, it is best implemented as a generic file system wrapper that can\n * cache data from arbitrary file systems.\n *\n * For inflation, we use `pako`'s implementation:\n * https://github.com/nodeca/pako\n *\n * Current limitations:\n * * No encryption.\n * * No ZIP64 support.\n * * Read-only.\n *   Write support would require that we:\n *   - Keep track of changed/new files.\n *   - Compress changed files, and generate appropriate metadata for each.\n *   - Update file offsets for other files in the zip file.\n *   - Stream it out to a location.\n *   This isn't that bad, so we might do this at a later date.\n */\nexport default class ZipFS extends SynchronousFileSystem implements FileSystem {\n  public static readonly Name = \"ZipFS\";\n\n  public static readonly Options: FileSystemOptions = {\n    zipData: {\n      type: \"object\",\n      description: \"The zip file as a Buffer object.\",\n      validator: bufferValidator\n    },\n    name: {\n      type: \"string\",\n      optional: true,\n      description: \"The name of the zip file (optional).\"\n    }\n  };\n\n  public static readonly CompressionMethod = CompressionMethod;\n\n  /**\n   * Constructs a ZipFS instance with the given options.\n   */\n  public static Create(opts: ZipFSOptions, cb: BFSCallback<ZipFS>): void {\n    try {\n      ZipFS.computeIndex(opts.zipData, (zipTOC) => {\n        const fs = new ZipFS(zipTOC, opts.name, false);\n        cb(null, fs);\n      }, false);\n    } catch (e) {\n      cb(e);\n    }\n  }\n\n  public static isAvailable(): boolean { return true; }\n\n  public static RegisterDecompressionMethod(m: CompressionMethod, fcn: (data: Buffer, compressedSize: number, uncompressedSize: number, flags: number) => Buffer): void {\n    decompressionMethods[m] = fcn;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * **Deprecated.

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\nfunction TransformState(stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function (er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n  this.writeencoding = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb) return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (data !== null && data !== undefined) stream.push(data);\n\n  cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(this);\n\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  if (options) {\n    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n\n    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n  }\n\n  // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  this.once('prefinish', function () {\n    if (typeof this._flush === 'function') this._flush(function (er, data) {\n      done(stream, er, data);\n    });else done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.

Then the code starts with all zero bits\n   for the first code of the shortest length, and the codes are integer\n   increments for the same length, and zeros are appended as the length\n   increases.  For the deflate format, these bits are stored backwards\n   from their more natural integer increment ordering, and so when the\n   decoding tables are built in the large loop below, the integer codes\n   are incremented backwards.\n\n   This routine assumes, but does not check, that all of the entries in\n   lens[] are in the range 0..MAXBITS.  The caller must assure this.\n   1..MAXBITS is interpreted as that code length.  zero means that that\n   symbol does not occur in this code.\n\n   The codes are sorted by computing a count of codes for each length,\n   creating from that a table of starting indices for each length in the\n   sorted table, and then entering the symbols in order in the sorted\n   table.
